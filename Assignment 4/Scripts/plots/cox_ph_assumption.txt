The ``p_value_threshold`` is set at 0.05. Even under the null hypothesis of no violations, some
covariates will be below the threshold by chance. This is compounded when there are many covariates.
Similarly, when there are lots of observations, even minor deviances from the proportional hazard
assumption will be flagged.

With that in mind, it's best to use a combination of statistical tests and visual tests to determine
the most serious violations. Produce visual plots using ``check_assumptions(..., show_plots=True)``



1. Variable 'Age' failed the non-proportional test: p-value is 0.0003.

   Advice 1: the functional form of the variable 'Age' might be incorrect. That is, there may be
non-linear terms missing. The proportional hazard test used is very sensitive to incorrect

   Advice 2: try binning the variable 'Age' using pd.cut, and then specify it in `strata=['Age',
